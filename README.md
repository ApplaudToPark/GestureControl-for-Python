# Notice
- Every file in this repository is in the team <Fancy Child>'s possessions.
- It could be used for a qualification for something.
- The participants in this projects are 박민석, 김영현, 최예진, 박고은.
- And the project was shown in Capstone Design Competition held in Chung-Ang Univ. in Seoul.
- The competition is held from May, 2023 to October 6th, 2023.
- It is ok to run the code for curiosities, but it cannot be used in competitions and for beneficial usage.

## Introduction
This codes are simply explained by watching videos. There's links to understand this codes. (https://github.com/ApplaudToPark/GestureControl-for-Python/issues/11#issue-2317624579)
The main codes operate on opencv modules to recognize hand joint. If you move their hand with specific gesture to control electronic devices, the algorithms make devices function instantaneously.

## Derivation
TV or other electronic devices have much more functions, but controllers are much simpler. It is hard to control any devices using simple controller, Certainly. So out team think that using hand gesture make it convenient to control electronic devices.

### The Release
- It would be needed to run the code with "main_code_final.py" and "HandTrackingModule.py"
- And also you need to install python and that modules :
  cv2, numpy, comtypes, pycaw, pyautogui, mediapipe
- If it is not installed, you cannot run the codes normally.
- You can watch the video in <issue> menu, which contains the demonstration of the codes :
